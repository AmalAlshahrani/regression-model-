# Housing Sale Project MVP

The main objective is to create a model that predicts the real-estate prices using one of the most commonly machine learning method which is Linear Regression.real-estate data were scraped and collected from AQAR and Propertyfinder websites which are a property search websites. The data were properly cleaned, and EDA were performed to further analyze and explore patterns and correlations between the variables/features. Here is some of the results we have explored : 




The next step will be working on the models (linear regression model, Lasso model, stats models, sklearn, poly nomial).
we need to do analysis in order to increase the R and increase the cross validation score, also, we need to do more plots to see the fit of the model.
